# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My project resembles a very simple Portofolio page of myself.

This folder includes all the html, css, scss files to build my webpage with the requirements from Project 0.
In images I included the most of the images i've used. And some are in the main folder with other files, due to some technical problems I encoutered.

As you can see, for each page I've create either a .css or .scss file, and didn't use the <style> tag at all, as I see that this way is easier and more comfortable way to write a code when you have lots of css.

Malibu.css is the style sheet for index.html (main page) and the others are named accordinally. I used .scss for two of my pages, where in the 'about.scss' I practiced inheritance and @media mobile responsive query. 
While on 'contactstyle.scss' practiced nesting and SASS variable called $mycolor.

Bootstrap 4 has been used on all of my html pages mainly to create my 'Navigation menu' but also other things like a 'contact form' on contact.html.


I hope you like it!
